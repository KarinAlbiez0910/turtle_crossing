Turtle street crossing game

The goal is to move the turtle across the street without getting hit by one of the cars.

You can move the turtle up with the "Up" key on your keyboard.

Once you have successfully crossed the street (reached the top of the screen), you reach one point.

Your turtle is reset to the starting position and you can cross the street again with an increased car speed!
